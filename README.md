### What is it?

This app at its core is simple. It will be an archive of vinyl records for sale and categorized by artist. We won't be implementing a ton of foreign logic but rather just getting the foundations of an API-based application in order. We'll touch on authentication (not using Devise) and basic CRUD.

There will be two apps.

- A Ruby on Rails backend - This will handle our data, sessions, and authentication and uses PostgreSQL
- A Vue.js frontend - This will be the view layer but also the one responsible for sending and receiving data to our rails-based backend. The front-end (recordstore-front) will run on a different instance using the [Vue-CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/) to help us set up an app.
Also an alternative version of this (store-front) with Nuxt JS [Nuxt.js docs](https://nuxtjs.org). to give us more options .
